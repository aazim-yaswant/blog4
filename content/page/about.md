<center><b>Pwn-Eat-Sleep-Repeat</b> </center>

I am Aazim Bill SE Yaswant, also known as 'h3rucl35'.

I am doing my Undergraduate in Computer Science at Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Roorkee.

My major field of interest is Information Security and have started taking part in Capture The Flag competitions from 2017 with my team InfoSecIITR.

When I started my B.Tech as a fresher, a single interaction with [Jay Bosamiya](https://github.com/jaybosmiya), my mentor made me fall in never-ending love with Information Security.

Currently, being a Sophomore I intend to do open-source Project Contributions in Security Projects.


Anyone interested to talk to me can drop en email at _aazimcr@gmail.com_

## Purpose of the Website:
	
This site serves 3 purposes:

1). Detailed Writeups for CTFs I Participate with my Team InfoSecIITR.

2). Blogs on common bugs and how to exploit them to pwn a CTF challenge with examples.

3). Challenges which have something to learn from, I make writeup based on archived CTFs for better understanding.
