      <description>Pwn-Eat-Sleep-Repeat 
I am Aazim Bill SE Yaswant, also known as &amp;lsquo;h3rucl35&amp;rsquo;.
I am doing my Undergraduate in Computer Science at Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Roorkee.
My major field of interest is Information Security and have started taking part in Capture The Flag competitions from 2017 with my team InfoSecIITR.
When I started my B.Tech as a fresher, a single interaction with Jay Bosamiya, my mentor made me fall in never-ending love with Information Security.</description>
