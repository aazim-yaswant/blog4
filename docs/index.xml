      <description>Hello guys, Welcome to my first writeup.
challenge: pwn50
we are given a binary and asked to pwn.
My general procedure is to examine for BOF, FSB.
First i run the binary
Then use objdump to see the functions and the calls
Then use gdb-peda to analyse the flow and registers and stacks.
Now, lets examine it.
 file pwn50 :   strings pwn50 :   checksec pwn50 :  Information gathered:</description>

&amp;nbsp; Its a 64-bit binary with NX enabled and the elf contains &amp;quot;/bin/date&amp;quot; and a call to system()
&amp;nbsp; Two functions other than main: Hello and today.

2. strings:
3. checksec:
 Information gathered:
&amp;nbsp;pwn200 is a 32-bit binary and has no Security measures enabled. Not even NX, which enables Shellcode Injection. &amp;nbsp;LIBC functions read and puts are used in ELF.
Now, we run the binary:
./pwn200  Guys, please dont make all challenges on Buffer Overflows</description>

      <description>Under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential that we finish what we start? If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out. If I ended a relationship with a woman who hit me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly secure route because my soul has other ideas, I am a flake?</description>

      <description>You can write regular markdown here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage. I strongly encourage you to take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown - it&amp;rsquo;ll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.
Here is some bold text
Here is a secondary heading Here&amp;rsquo;s a useless table:
   Number Next number Previous number     Five Six Four   Ten Eleven Nine   Seven Eight Six   Two Three One    How about a yummy crepe?</description>

      <description>To be, or not to be&amp;ndash;that is the question: Whether &amp;lsquo;tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep&amp;ndash; No more&amp;ndash;and by a sleep to say we end The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to. &amp;lsquo;Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep&amp;ndash; To sleep&amp;ndash;perchance to dream: ay, there&amp;rsquo;s the rub, For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause.</description>

      <description>What is it with that Mary girl? Dragging me to school every day. As if I had a choice. What you don&amp;rsquo;t hear in those nursery rhymes is that she starves me if I don&amp;rsquo;t go to school with her; it&amp;rsquo;s the only way I can stay alive! I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about being adopted by Little Bo Peep, sure I may get lost, but anything is better than being with Mary and those little brats at school (shudder, shudder).</description>

      <description>Piracy is typically an act of robbery or criminal violence at sea. The term can include acts committed on land, in the air, or in other major bodies of water or on a shore. It does not normally include crimes committed against persons traveling on the same vessel as the perpetrator (e.g. one passenger stealing from others on the same vessel). The term has been used throughout history to refer to raids across land borders by non-state agents.</description>

      <description>Pwn-Eat-Sleep-Repeat 
I am Aazim Bill SE Yaswant, also known as &amp;lsquo;h3rucl35&amp;rsquo;.
I am doing my Undergraduate in Computer Science at Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Roorkee.
My major field of interest is Information Security and have started taking part in Capture The Flag competitions from 2017 with my team InfoSecIITR.
When I started my B.Tech as a fresher, a single interaction with Jay Bosamiya, my mentor made me fall in never-ending love with Information Security.</description>
